# Firmware Folder

Folder to store the firmware written for a given hardware project, be it Arduino sketches or other systems like PlatformIO. Anything is fine and valid, basic sensor unit tests to complete system firmware, just have them split into folders as appropriate.

Be sure to add the appropriate `.gitignore`s for the code written!
